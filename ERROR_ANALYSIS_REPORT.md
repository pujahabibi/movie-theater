# Movie Theater Application - Error Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The movie theater application was experiencing a **critical infrastructure issue** that prevented it from running as designed. The primary problem was the **absence of Docker and Docker Compose** in the current environment, which are essential for the application's containerized architecture.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Application is now fully operational with all services running successfully.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Docker Infrastructure Missing

The root cause of the application failure was the **absence of Docker and Docker Compose** in the Debian 12 environment. The application is designed as a containerized solution requiring Docker for all services.

### Specific Error Message

```bash
./run.sh: line 29: docker: command not found
```

**Location**: `/home/daytona/movie-theater/run.sh` at line 29  
**Command**: `docker compose up -d --build`  
**Impact**: Complete application failure - cannot start any services (database, backend, or frontend)

## Successful Resolution Steps

### Task 1: Docker Installation
Successfully installed Docker and Docker Compose on Debian 12:

```bash
# Update package repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io

# Install Docker Compose (standalone version)
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose

# Download and install Docker Compose v2 plugin
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /tmp/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /tmp/docker-compose
sudo mv /tmp/docker-compose /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose

# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker daytona

# Start Docker service
sudo service docker start
```

**Installation Results:**
- ✅ Docker version 20.10.24+dfsg1 installed successfully
- ✅ Docker Compose version v2.39.2 installed successfully
- ✅ Docker service running properly

### Task 2: Application Startup
Successfully executed the run.sh script:

```bash
sudo ./run.sh
```

**Startup Results:**
- ✅ Environment file created from `.env.example` template
- ✅ Project slug "movietheater" derived from directory name
- ✅ All containers built successfully (MySQL, Backend, Frontend)
- ✅ MySQL database initialized and became healthy
- ✅ Database schema applied using Prisma
- ✅ Sample data seeded successfully:
  - 3 movies (The Amazing Spider-Man, Inception, The Lion King)
  - 6 showtimes across 2 theaters
  - 600 seats (100 per showtime)
  - 6 snack items

### Task 3: Service Verification
Comprehensive health checks performed and passed:

```bash
# Container logs - all services running without errors
sudo docker compose logs

# Health endpoint verification
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
# Result: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-08-12T15:46:13.137Z","environment":"production","database":"connected"}

# Frontend accessibility verification
curl -I http://localhost:5173
# Result: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# API functionality verification
curl http://localhost:4000/api/movies
# Result: Successfully returned seeded movie data
```

### 2. Version Compatibility Issues

#### Node.js Version Mismatch
- **Current Version**: v24.1.0
- **Required Version**: Node.js 20.19.1 (specified in Dockerfiles)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Potential compatibility issues
- **Impact**: May cause runtime errors if running locally

#### Dependencies Status
- **Backend Dependencies**: ❌ Not installed locally (`node_modules` missing)
- **Frontend Dependencies**: ❌ Not installed locally
- **Status**: Would require `npm install` in both directories for local development

### 3. Database Configuration

#### MySQL Database
- **Type**: MySQL 8.0 (containerized)
- **Status**: ❌ Cannot start without Docker
- **Configuration**: Properly configured in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Health Checks**: Implemented and functional

#### Prisma ORM
- **Schema**: ✅ Valid and well-structured
- **Configuration**: ✅ Properly configured for MySQL
- **Migrations**: ✅ Handled via `npx prisma db push`

### 4. Application Architecture Analysis

#### Backend (Express.js)
- **Status**: ✅ Code integrity verified
- **Configuration**: Properly structured with:
  - ✅ Error handling middleware
  - ✅ CORS configuration
  - ✅ Security headers (Helmet)
  - ✅ Request logging (Morgan)
  - ✅ Health check endpoint
- **API Routes**: ✅ All routes have proper error handling

#### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Status**: ✅ Code integrity verified
- **Configuration**: ✅ Properly configured
- **API Integration**: ✅ Axios interceptors for error handling
- **Build Process**: ✅ Vite configuration is correct

#### Database Schema
- **Status**: ✅ Valid Prisma schema
- **Models**: Complete with proper relationships
- **Constraints**: Appropriate unique constraints and foreign keys

## Error Categories

### Critical Errors (Application Cannot Start)
1. **Docker not installed** - Prevents all services from starting
2. **Docker Compose not available** - Cannot orchestrate multi-container setup

### Warning Issues (Potential Problems)
1. **Node.js version mismatch** - May cause compatibility issues
2. **Missing local dependencies** - Required for local development
3. **No .env file** - Now resolved with .env.example

### Non-Issues (Working Correctly)
1. **Application code** - No syntax or logic errors found
2. **Configuration files** - All properly structured
3. **Database schema** - Valid and complete
4. **Error handling** - Comprehensive throughout the application

## Root Cause Analysis

The **root cause** of the application failure is the **missing Docker infrastructure**. The application is architected as a containerized solution with:

- MySQL database container
- Node.js backend container  
- React frontend container (served via Nginx)
- Docker Compose orchestration

Without Docker, none of these services can start, making the application completely non-functional.

## Impact Assessment

### High Impact
- ❌ Application cannot start
- ❌ No database connectivity
- ❌ API endpoints unreachable
- ❌ Frontend cannot be served

### Medium Impact
- ⚠️ Local development not possible without setup
- ⚠️ Node.js version compatibility concerns

### Low Impact
- ✅ Code quality is good
- ✅ Configuration is correct
- ✅ Architecture is sound

## Next Steps Required

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose** (Critical)
2. **Verify Node.js version compatibility** (Recommended)
3. **Run the application using `./run.sh`** (After Docker installation)
4. **Test health endpoints** (Verification)

## Files Analyzed

- ✅ `/backend/src/app.js` - Express configuration
- ✅ `/backend/src/server.js` - Server startup
- ✅ `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- ✅ `/backend/package.json` - Dependencies
- ✅ `/frontend/package.json` - Frontend dependencies
- ✅ `/docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- ✅ `/run.sh` - Deployment script
- ✅ `/.env.example` - Environment template

## Conclusion

The movie theater application is **well-architected and properly coded**. The error is purely **infrastructure-related** due to missing Docker installation. Once Docker is installed, the application should start successfully using the provided `run.sh` script.

**Confidence Level**: High - The issue is clearly identified and the solution is straightforward.
